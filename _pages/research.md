## Mapping of functional genomic variants in human disease risk

It has been largely unknown which and how genomic variants affect gene expression level and human disease risk. Previously I have worked on developing computational methods for identifying functional variants in the human genome.

### Mapping of promoter usage QTL

I developed a computational method that enables mapping of genomic variants associated with promoter activity, called promoter usage QTL (puQTL).
