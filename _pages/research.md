## RNA splicing in mammalian brain development and disease

Coming soon...

## Software development for systematic identification of differential RNA splicing

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a fundamental regulatory process that generates transcript diversity and cell type variation. Several computational tools have been developed to analyze AS from RNA-seq data, but they are often limited by the high false-positive rate and low reproducibility. I have developed a versatile computational method, called [***Shiba***](https://github.com/Sika-Zheng-Lab/Shiba), that enables systematic identification of differential RNA splicing across platforms, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.

## Mapping of functional genomic variants in human disease risk

It has been largely unknown which and how genomic variants affect gene expression level and human disease risk. Previously I have worked on developing computational methods for identifying functional variants in the human genome.

### Mapping of promoter usage QTL

I developed a computational method that enables mapping of genomic variants associated with promoter activity, called promoter usage QTL (puQTL).
